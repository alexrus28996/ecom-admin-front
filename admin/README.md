# Ecom Admin (Angular)

Comprehensive Angular admin application for the e-commerce backend. The codebase is organised around feature areas (auth, catalog, orders, inventory, payments) and consumes the REST surface described in [`API.md`](./API.md).

> ðŸ’¡ Looking for the full platform overview, route map, and extension guide? Head over to [`README_ADMIN.md`](./README_ADMIN.md).

## Quick start

```bash
cd admin
npm install
npm start
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:4200` and proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:4000` via [`proxy.conf.json`](./proxy.conf.json). To target a different backend, adjust `apiBaseUrl` inside [`src/environments/environment.ts`](./src/environments/environment.ts).

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Running backend that exposes the endpoints in `API.md`

## First-time admin tips

- The first registered user becomes an admin automatically (per backend logic).
- Otherwise, login as an existing admin and use **Admin â†’ Manage User Roles** to promote another user by their ID.

## Tooling scripts

- `npm start` â†’ dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` â†’ production build to `dist/admin`

## Definition of Done (Phase 1)

- [x] All API calls typed and error-handled.
- [x] Permissions enforced at route & widget level.
- [x] CSV export works on all tables.
- [x] No hardcoded data; all live via API.
- [x] Lighthouse a11y score â‰¥ 90 for key pages.
