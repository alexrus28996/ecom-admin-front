# TODO — Zip 1 (Auth + Shell)

- [ ] Hook i18n loader in root app module if not already.
- [ ] Verify `environment.apiBase` is correct for your backend.
- [ ] Connect your logo in `topbar.component.html`.
- [ ] Review role check in `AdminGuard` maps to your `user.roles` (expects string[]).
- [ ] Add dark theme toggle (stub exists in topbar actions; wire your theme switcher if desired).
- [ ] Add telemetry (optional) by listening to `ErrorInterceptor` global stream.
- [ ] Replace quick stat cards on dashboard with your real KPIs (they’re componentized).
